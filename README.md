### Welcome to OpenVOGEL!
This project is about developing an open source computer program useful to solve aerodynamic and aeroelastic problems. OpenVOGEL can be used to calculate approximated values of the airloads over complex configurations of slender and thick surfaces (wings and fuselages), and to compute some important aeroelastic characteristics of wings.

If you are looking for documentation, then visit our wikibook at https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Open_VOGEL.
If you have questions about the software, or if you want to share data and/or contact other users, you can join the google group at  https://sites.google.com/site/gahvogel/main.

Open VOGEL has been programmed in VB.NET and C#, which are integral part of the open sourced .NET framework. This is a very mature development platform that makes programming quite easy, while still providing a very good level of calculation performance (it can be less powerful than native C or FORTRAN, but it is easier to work with and certainly faster than any implementation in an interpreted language like Python or Scilab).
